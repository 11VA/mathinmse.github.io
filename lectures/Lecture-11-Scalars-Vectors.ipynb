The rate of change depends on the direction that you want to \"go\" (imagine you are walking along the surface).

In the first instance we can use the coordinate system capabilities of Sympy so that we can access the built in function gradient().  We start by defining a coordinate system and then calling gradient on our scalar function.  Scalars and vectors are objects of the coordinate system.
