Structure your solution/code so that you can investigate the series as a function of the number of terms it contains.  It will be helpful to pay attention to the values of the wavenumber and coefficients.  (Maybe symbolic computation will help?)  By choosing hte `sin` series you will also be requiring the values of the function to be zero at the boundaries.  Hint:  The domain of the series may be larger than the domain of the physical problem.\n",
