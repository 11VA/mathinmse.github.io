    "This series may be used in the solution of ordinary differential and partial differential equations.  In materials engineering you will sometimes see diffusion problems use series solutions to describe the evolution of a concentration field where there is a factor composed of an infinite series and a factor containing an exponential in time.  Together they are selected to describe the diffusive evolution of a system.  A classic example of a Fourier series in the solution to a diffusion problem is in Jackson and Hunt's paper on eutectic solidification.  In that paper the boundary condition was represented by a Fourier series to model the composition profile across eutectic lamellae."
