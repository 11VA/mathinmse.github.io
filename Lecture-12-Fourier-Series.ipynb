    "\n",
    "Series solutions appear in a lot of different engineering contexts.  In materials engineering you will sometimes see diffusion problems use series solutions to describe the evolution of a concentration field.  You will often see solutions to the diffusion problem where there is a series factor and an exponential factor.  Together they describe the diffusive evolution of a system.  A classic example of a Fourier series in a diffusion problem is in Jackson and Hunt's paper on eutectic solidification.  In that paper the boundary condition was represented by a Fourier series to model the composition profile across eutectic lamellae.\n",

So, they should have wavelengths of P, P/2, P/3, P/4, etc. This choice turns out to also have a very useful property: such functions are all mutually orthagonal.

This is exactly what we are after in terms of functions: how much of function 1 do you have to add to some other (mutually orthagonal) functions to reproduce your desired function.

They are necessarily parallel, so their dot product is just the product of their magnitudes = f(a) times g(a). Now, multiply this by dx to keep the contribution from position x=a proportional to how many additional x-positions you'll do this for. Take this dot product over and over, at each x-position, always scaling by dx to keep it all in proportion. The sum of these dot products is the projection of f(x) onto g(x) (or vice-versa).\n",
